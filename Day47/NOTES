//static initilizer block
//it will ony run once when the Class is loaded
//it is used to initialize the static fields value before
//the types first usage and it'll run only 1 time before its usage

//if you have more than one block 
//it will run in the order it appears


//import is used to import the type thats not under the package
//static import
//>>is used to import the visible static member of another class
//we use the keyword import static yourClassname.staticMember;
//just like import the class, we can use .* to import all static members


Instance block
    -is a block of code that runs everytime an object is being created
    right before constructor class

    {
        your code goes here
    }
    How is this useful?
    -- if you have block of code that shaed among all of your constructor,
    you can put it in instance block to reduce duplicate

    ANY OCA QUESTION YOU GOT ABOUT INSTANCE BLOCK
      just copy everything inside instance block and insert in into each and every constructor
