Defualt behavior of compilers:

    anything under java.lang package is automatically imported 
    and no need for explicit import statement
    for example: String class, System, Object

    non-final fields of the class:
      get default value of 0 for numbers, false for boolean
     empty char for char, null for reference variable

     int i = 'a' l ---> 97;

    automatic type widening | upcasting
        long ; = 10 --> 10L;

    autoboxing | auto unboxing
        Integer i1 = 10 ---? new Integer(10);
        int i2 = new Integer(12) ---> 12;

    Constructor:
        if we dont define any constructor
                ---> compiler will provide defauly no arg constructor
                (as long as any constructor is defined we dont get one)

        first statement of any constructor is a call to super classes
        no arg constructor using super()
            (as long as no other constructor call is made already)

    Inheritance:
        if a class does not explicitly extends another class 
        it will implicitly extends opject class

    Interface:
        all the fields in interface are automatically public static final 
        (and can not be marked with other access modifier) like private/protected 

        all the method without body are automatically public abstract:
        everything in interface are implicitly public


Extends vs Implements

    a class extends another class (only one directly)
    
    an interface extends another interface (one or more interfaces) 
    
    a class implements n interface(one or more)
