Inheritance:

    Why do we need it?
    a class can extend another class
    to inherit fields and methods

    What is inherited?
    all visible fields and methods
    constructo is NOT inherited

    We can just use all inherited members just like its our own

    and we have option to add new fields or meethods that does not exists in super class

    We can also change what super class provided

        fields
          if we declare a field that already exists in super class
              it will hide super class's field

              IT JUST NEED TO HAVE SAME NAME
              IT CAN HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE DIFFERENT

              How do we access a hidden field in sub class

            parent
                int capacity

            child
                long capacity

            super.capacity --> parent version
            this.capacity --> child class version


    
        methods
            static method

                a sub class define same method as super class, it hides super class' static method

            public class Person{
                public static void showRace{
                    print("Human");
                }
            }

            public class Spartan extends person{
                public static void showRace{
                    print ("Spartan");
                }
            }


            this. super. MUST NOT SHOW UP IN STATIC METHID
            instance members MUST NOT SHOW UP IN STATIC method

            public class Spartan extends person{

                @Override
                public void showRace(){
                    print "Spartan"
                }
            }

            Overloading  VS  Overriding
//------------------------------------------------------
            final keyword

        public final class Spartan{

        }
        public class Horse extends Spartan{} ======> ERROR, Cannot extend with "Final" keyword

        //-----------------------------------------
            public class Student{

            }

            public final class LocalStudent extends Student{ 

            }
            as long as a class is not final, it can be a super class
            a final class can be a sub class as well as its super class is not final
