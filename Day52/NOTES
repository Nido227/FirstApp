OOP: Object oritented programming
    -- 4 main concepts are: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism

Encapsulation: hides the instance variables( usuallly have private access modifiers )

    getter: Read ONLY
     1. return method (Return-Type cannot be void)
     2. access modifier Should not be private
     3. return Type must be same data-type with the instance variable'
     4. does not have any argument


    Setter: Modify
     1. none return method (void)
     2. access modifer should not be private
     3. must have an argument and argument' data-type MUST be same with instance variable
     4. argument must be initialized to the instance variable

Inheritance: builds relationship between classes (super and sub)
    0.  class A     extends     class B
            sub                       sub
    
    1. sub class inherits all the inheritable features from the super class

      features (blocks, or methods, or fields) that are not inheritable in super class:
           1. features with private access modifer
           2. feature with default access modifer (if sub class and super class not)
           3. abstract methods (if the sub class is not abstact class)
    
    2. super class cannot inherit any features from the sub class

    3. A class can only extend one class. A class can be extended by multiple classes

    4. super class cannot be final
