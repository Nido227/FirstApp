Inheritance

public Computer extends Electronic{

}

What is inherited from super class

All visible fields and methods from super class
constructor is NOT inherited


Access modifier
private --- same class only
default --- same package only
protected --- same package + sub classes outside the package
public --- everywhere


Implicit behavior of compiler

automatic type widening / up casting
long i = 10;

Wrapper type auto boxing and unboxing
Integer i = 10;
i = new Integer(10);

Constructor
  if you dont have any constructor
  compiler will add no arg constructor

  public YourClassName(){

  }

  first line of any constructo is always a call to 
  super class no arg constructor if its not already called
  using either super(args..) or this(args.)

  public YourClassName(){
    super();
  }
