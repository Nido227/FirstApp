What can we have inside one class



//Inheritance
  -  class can extend use fields and methods from another class by extending it, instead of creating everything from scratch

  IS-A Relationship
    Student IS-A Person
    LocalStudent IS-A Student
    Car - Vehicle

    What keyword to build Relationship
        public class Student extends Person{

        }

        How many class a class can extends directly
           a class can only extend one another class directlt
           BAD:
           public class Student extends Person, Human, Robot{}

        Child--> Parent --> GrandParent --> Object (is an actual class)
        Child c1 = new Child();
        c1.everyVisibleFieldsAndMethod....

        Whats inherited from super class
            All visible fields / methods from super class
            Constructor IS NOT INHERITED

        Visibility:
            private: in same class
            default: in same package
            protected: same package + sub classes outside package
            public: everywhere

        Constructor: 
            how can we call other constructor of same class
                this(arg..)
                    has to be the first statement
                    can only be called once
                    recursive calls should be avoided ( you call me, i call you --compiler error)

            how can we call super class constructor
                super(arg..)
                    has to be the first statement
                    an only be called once
                    if no constructor call is made already
                        super() will be inseted in first line
                    super() and this() can not show up together in same constructor
                    CAN NOT CALL A CONSTRUCOT THAT WE DONT HAVE
            
        super(args..)
